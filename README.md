# PlanetScope_Phenology

This package contains code and test data for processing leaf phenology using PlanetScope data to support Yang et al. "Fine-scale Landscape Characteristics, Vegetation Composition, and Snowmelt Timing Control Phenological Heterogeneity across low-Arctic Tundra Landscapes in Western Alaska" under review for publication in Environmental Research Ecology 

Due to the large size of the test data, we included the data through GitHub large data tag release available at https://github.com/Daryl-YANG/PlanetScope_Phenology/releases/tag/test_data
